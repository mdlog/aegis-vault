## What it is

Aegis Vault lets a user deposit stablecoins into a vault, pick an AI operator from an on-chain marketplace, and let autonomous execution happen inside a narrow, enforced policy. The AI can only *propose* trades; the vault contract enforces every rule (max position, stop-loss, cooldowns, slippage, allowed assets, fee caps, cross-chain replay protection). Every decision is logged, every fee is split 80/20 with the protocol treasury, every slash is governance-gated, and every operator carries on-chain reputation that users can sort on.

Built for **Track 2 — Agentic Trading Arena (Verifiable Finance)**: inference runs on 0G Compute (GLM-5-FP8), the output hash is bound into an EIP-712 intent, a TEE signer attests the decision, and commit–reveal prevents front-running — enforced on-chain with no trusted middleman.

## Live on 0G Aristotle Mainnet (chain 16661)

V3 vault stack with the Khalani cross-chain adapter shipped **2026-04-27** after audit-pass hardening (235 contract tests). The operator marketplace contracts (registry / staking / reputation / insurance) were redeployed the same day for a clean post-audit baseline.

Live tokens include `USDC.e`, `W0G`, `USDT`, `WETH`, `cbBTC` — see [`contracts/deployments-mainnet.json`](contracts/deployments-mainnet.json) for the full address book and active Jaine pool list.

**Arbitrum One mirror** (chain `42161`, deployed 2026-04-21): V1 stack only — `AegisVaultFactory` at [`0x49354460eAdE1C2E786E36B3B3e7A18Fb4283C45`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x49354460eAdE1C2E786E36B3B3e7A18Fb4283C45) with Uniswap V3 venue and Pyth NAV. The full marketplace stack (`OperatorRegistry`, `Staking`, `Reputation`, `Governor`, `InsurancePool`) currently lives only on 0G. Full Arbitrum address book: [`contracts/deployments-arbitrum.json`](contracts/deployments-arbitrum.json). See [`docs/ARBITRUM_BRINGUP.md`](docs/ARBITRUM_BRINGUP.md) for the V3 parity plan.

**First on-chain execution** (AI → policy → DEX, end-to-end): [`0x7efe51ac…`](https://chainscan.0g.ai/tx/0x7efe51ac) on **2026-04-24** — orchestrator cycle BUY 0G on Jaine, signed by the TEE signer, verified through `AegisVault.executeIntent()`. (Recorded against the V2 vault stack that preceded the V3 cutover; the V3 reputation registry starts fresh.)

> **Pyth oracle guard note (Jaine adapter):** `OracleGuardLib.checkDeviation()` is wired into every venue adapter, but the on-chain Pyth feeds on 0G are not currently pushed frequently enough to satisfy the 5-minute staleness check. The guard is therefore set to `address(0)` on the live `JaineVenueAdapter`, and the adapter's `maxSlippageBps` cap is the active price-protection mechanism. The guard will be re-enabled once Pyth Hermes push cadence on 0G meets the threshold (or migrated to a pull-at-swap model). Pyth is still used in production by `VaultNAVCalculator` for share-price NAV computation.

**Slim build**: `AegisVault` is 3.4 KB (was 16 KB) so it fits 0G's per-block gas limit. Heavy logic is in 3 external libraries; the factory deploys vaults as EIP-1167 minimal proxies (~2.7 KB each).

**Sealed mode** (optional per vault): strategy params never leave the TEE. The orchestrator commits `keccak(intentHash, reportHash)` at block N, executes at block ≥ N+1, and `SealedLib` verifies the ECDSA signature against `policy.attestedSigner`. `attestationReportHash` binds the execution to the specific 0G Compute provider + chat session.

## Security guarantees

- **AI has zero authority.** It can only propose intents. Every trade runs through the vault's policy check (`ExecLib`).
- **Single-use intents.** EIP-712 hashes are tracked by `ExecutionRegistry` — replay-proof across chains and across vaults.
- **Fee caps are code, not policy.** `perf ≤ 30% · mgmt ≤ 5% · entry/exit ≤ 2%` enforced in `AegisVault.initialize()` and cannot be raised later.
- **Sealed mode**: only `policy.attestedSigner` can authorize execution — enforced by `SealedLib.verifyAttestation()`.
- **Commit–reveal**: sealed intent committed at block N cannot execute before block N+1. Anti-MEV.
- **Slash + treasury spend**: every motion passes through `AegisGovernor` M-of-N approval.
- **CI gate**: Slither runs with `fail-on: high` on every contracts/ change — [security.yml](.github/workflows/security.yml).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Contracts
cd contracts && npm install
npm run test:all                 # 235 passing

# 2. Orchestrator
cd ../orchestrator && npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cp .env.example .env             # fill EXECUTOR_PRIVATE_KEY + TEE_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY + 0G keys
npm start                        # API on :4002

# 3. Frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install
npm run dev                      # :5173

# 4. SDK (optional, for programmatic access)
cd ../sdk && npm install
npm test                         # 73 passing
```

**One-shot with Docker:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build        # orchestrator :4002 + frontend :8080
```

**MetaMask networks**

- Mainnet — RPC `https://evmrpc.0g.ai` · Chain `16661` · Symbol `0G`

**Deploy fresh stack** (production):
```bash
cd contracts
GOVERNOR_OWNERS="0xaaa,0xbbb,0xccc" GOVERNOR_THRESHOLD=2 \
ARBITRATOR_ADDRESS=0xddd TRANSFER_ADMINS=1 CONFIRM_MAINNET=1 \
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mainnet.js --network og_mainnet

```

## Economic model (default)

- Perf fee **15%** (max 30%) — only on net-new profit above high-water mark
- Mgmt fee **2%/yr** (max 5%) — streamed on NAV
- Entry / exit **0% / 0.5%** (max 2% each)
- Every fee: **80% operator · 20% protocol treasury**
- Operator stake → vault size cap: None $5k · Bronze ($1k) $50k · Silver ($10k) $500k · Gold ($100k) $5M · Platinum ($1M) unlimited
- Slash up to 50% per governance action → funds flow to `InsurancePool` for user claims

## Repo layout

```
contracts/       Hardhat — 15 core contracts + 174-test suite, Slither CI
orchestrator/    Node.js — 0G Compute client, EIP-712 signer, cycle runner, REST API
frontend/        React + Vite + wagmi — vault UI, operator marketplace, governance
sdk/             @aegis-vault/sdk v0.3.0 — ethers v6 clients + orchestrator HTTP wrapper
docker-compose.yml  one-command local bring-up (orchestrator + frontend)
```

## V3 audit-pass surface

Factory role separation (depositor/owner ≠ executor), owner emergency controls (`pause`/`unpause`/`setExecutor`/`setVenue`), on-chain `maxPositionBps` trade-size cap, `consumedKhalaniIds` double-credit guard, multi-factory `ExecutionRegistry` (`authorizedFactories` + Ownable2Step admin), Pyth confidence-band check in `OracleGuardLib`, 80/20 protocol fee split. Deploy procedure: [`docs/V3_KHALANI_ROLLOUT.md`](docs/V3_KHALANI_ROLLOUT.md).

## What's next (roadmap)

- **Arbitrum V3 parity** — port `OperatorRegistry`, `Staking`, `Reputation`, `Governor`, `InsurancePool`, then V3 vault + Khalani onto Arbitrum One.
- **External operator onboarding** — open `OperatorRegistry` to the first wave of third-party operators using [`OPERATOR_REGISTRATION_KIT.md`](OPERATOR_REGISTRATION_KIT.md).
- **Phase 3 Khalani auto-execution end-to-end** — orchestrator submission flow ready (`submitCrossChainIntent`), gated by per-vault `maxCrossChainFeeBps` ≥ Khalani solver fee.
- **Pyth deviation guard re-enable** on Jaine adapter once 0G push cadence is acceptable.

See [`docs/PRODUCT_VALUE_AND_MARKET_POTENTIAL.md`](docs/PRODUCT_VALUE_AND_MARKET_POTENTIAL.md) for the full phased roadmap (Phase 0 → Phase 5).
